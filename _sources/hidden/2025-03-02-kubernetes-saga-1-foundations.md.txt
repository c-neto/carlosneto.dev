# Kubernetes Saga #1 - Foundations

# **What is it for?**  

Kubernetes is an OpenSource Container Orchestration Platform that provide tooling to manage workload that requires scalable 


# **What is it for?**  

It manages resource allocation, load balancing, and automatic scaling while ensuring high availability and fault tolerance.  

# **What problem does it solve?**  

It simplifies the operation of large-scale applications by eliminating the need for manual infrastructure management, making systems more resilient and efficient.  

# **What makes it different?**  

Kubernetes stands out for its **intelligent and automated orchestration**, offering **self-healing, auto-scaling, load balancing, infrastructure portability, and declarative management**, making it the ideal choice for distributed and scalable applications.

# Kubernetes running only in Cloud?

# It make sense running Kubernetes in Single Intance?

# Kubernetes is designed to be Scalable?

# The Kubernetes declarative language is interoperable to all providers?

# Kubernetes Extensible... what differences does make?

Kubernetes is an **open-source container orchestration platform** that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.  

# Then... Kubernets is good and other is bad?


## Conclusion

- kubernetes is complex because solves complex challanges
- kubernetes is no about run container, is about to offer the tooling to support scalable, distribuited, ireinted by high available application requirements
- as all technology solution, it is created to solve a problem.
